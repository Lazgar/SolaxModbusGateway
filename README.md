This project implements a Gateway for Solar Inverters with Modbus-RTU communication to MQTT on ESP32 basis.  
Direkt Communication with [OpenWB](https://openwb.de) is implemented.
Sending "set" commands to inverter are basically implemented too.

### Supported Solar Inverters
Basically, all Inverters with Modbus RS485 RTU communication are supported.  
Currently the following Inverters with their special registers are integrated:
* Solax Hybrid X1
* Solax Hybrid X3 
* Solax MIC
* Growatt SPH
* Sofar-KTL Solarmax-SGA
* Deye Sun SG04LP3

If your Solar Inverter is not listed, it´s quite simple to add it by yourself. Feel free to add the special registers, please check the [wiki page](configuration-register) or contact me by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/tobiasfaust/SolaxModbusGateway/issues) in github.

### What you need
* ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP-S2 or ESP-S3 NodeMCU
* RS-485 TTL UART Module with MAX485 Semiconductor 

An ESP8266 is actually not sufficient, because Modbus communication works fail-free only with hardwareserial. ESP8266 has only one Hardwareserial port which is used by serial/debug output. ESP32 has 3 Hardewareserial ports and we use one of them. Another reason is available memory for such huge json definition or such large modbus answers.  
Please check also the wiki page, [how to wire the circuit](https://github.com/tobiasfaust/SolaxModbusGateway/wiki/wiring-the-circuit).

### How to start
It´s recommend to start with one example to check wiring works correctly. Both LED´s (TX and RX) on your RS-485 module should blink. If only TX-LED blinks, please check: 
* wiring
* baud rate

The example requests the inverter SerialNumber and if wiring is correct, the inverter will answer with his number or soomething like this.
